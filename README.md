# terraform-actions-slackbot
terraform github actions slackbot

Objective
Build a slack bot using Python & its open source libraries. For example, you might choose to use the Bolt Library. Deploy this slackbot to AWS using Terraform, either to the EC2 free tier (with or without a docker container), Lightsail, or to AWS lambda with an API gateway, or any other method youâ€™d choose.


Bonus: Consider adding a CI/CD pipeline that will deploy code updates to your infrastructure of choice. Divvy uses Gitlab, but you can use Github actions or any other CI/CD platform.


Demo this slackbot during our follow up interview. 


Use whatever sources or tutorials you can find. Document your assumptions 


Acceptance Criteria:
A slackbot that responds to input from a human or some other event. Deployed to AWS using terraform.
